# CIFAR-10-CNN

I worked in a team to create and train a Convulsion Neural Network which classified images into 10 categories
using the CIFAR-10 data set containing 60,000 RGB images of size 32x32.

The following libraries need to be installed to run the code:
  1. _Pickle
  2. matplotlib
  3. keras
  4. tensorflow
